# My ARCH install script.
## This is currently unmaintained! ##

**NOTE**: This was made for my personal use + this is my first bash script, please edit the file the way you want if you want to run it, but I will NOT help you.

**TO USE**
```
chmod +x ./arch_install.sh
./arch_install.sh
```

# Thanks!

Thanks to bugswriter for his archinstall script, I have based mine on it.
